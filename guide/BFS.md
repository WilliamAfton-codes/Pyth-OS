# Build From Source

Step 1: open terminal and do this command:
```

git clone https://github.com/WilliamAfton-codes/Pyth-OS/
```

Step 2: Just run launch.py and enjoy ;)

Note that I recommend downloading Pyth-OS from the releases, rather than from the source, as I will be updating the releases more often
