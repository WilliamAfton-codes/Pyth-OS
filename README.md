A personal project of mine to create a working OS based on Python 3.10

Note: THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL OS, ITS SIMPLY AN OS-LIKE PROJECT I MADE FOR FUN

This has been a project idea of mine for a while, and I've finally made it a reality. Support is appreciated!

# Features
A web browser

A text editor

A BioS Utility (shows system information)

A non-gui Virtual Assistant using Wolfram|Alpha API (can understand normal language and handles HUGE math calculations)

A working Powershell command line

A bunch of games (including DOOM)

# Requirements
Python 3.10

PIP (comes pre-bundled with python)

# Usage
[1] Download Pyth-OS.zip and unzip

[2] Open CMD and cd to Pyth-OS folder

[3] In CMD, enter command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[4] Run launch.py and have fun!

(Optional install from source [here](guide/BFS.md))

# Notes
Please make sure that your user's password and the root password are different, otherwise issues may occur.

~~When exiting Powershell, type 'exit' twice, this is due to an error that I can't seem to fix~~ (Issue fixed in latest release)

If you want to download Pyth-OS without DOOM, to save space or whatever, download Pyth-OS-noDOOM.zip from releases instead of Pyth-OS.zip


Thanks for using Pyth-OS, if you liked Pyth-OS please leave a star or follow my GitHub! Discord DMs are also open, friend me at William_Afton#2643 for any questions.
