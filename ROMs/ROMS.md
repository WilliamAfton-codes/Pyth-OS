# GameBoy ROMs
I have implemented GameBoy support using the pyboy library!

To get started, place your GameBoy ROM in the ROMs folder.

Next, run Pyth-OS and navigate to the Games menu as shown here:

Select the GameBoy Emulator option and type out your ROM name in full:

Once you run your game ROM, you might get confused on the controls, in which case refer to the key binds on the official doumentation [here](https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy/wiki/Installation#starting-pyboy).

This emulator supports GameBoy Classic and GameBoy Color ROMs (In .gb and .gbc format respectively)

# Notes
Firstly, I will _not_ be providing ROMs for the GameBoy Classic or Color, as redistribution of game files is **illegal** and I don't want to go to jail

I will also not be providing websites where you can download ROMs from, but I do suggest you legally rip the game image out of a game cartridge you already own

Thank you for using Pyth-OS and it really helps me out when you star my GitHub pages! I hope you have fun playing classic retro games in Pyth-OS
